**Lab overview**
1. Created a module
2. Opened a file and load the JSON data it contains using the built-in JSON module of Python
3. Parsed the JSON structure to access insulin data
4. Calculated the rough molecular weight of human insulin using the given code (similar to the lab Working with the String Sequence and Numeric Weight of Insulin in Python)
